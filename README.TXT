PROJECT TITLE: Banking program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: Last verision
AUTHOR: Duc Tran Tri 
Update all the missed method and features
All the options are available now
All the features are also available 
My plan is to save the data into an Excel file, but it is too hard for my skill level, so I just save the data into a CSV file, as I have learnt in class.
I have been testing multiple times, but there could be some bugs left that I have not figured out.

And lastly adding comments into every classes so it will be easier to understand the code.
